# Kumasi-B.-AbueloSolos-
Hellooo!
My name is Kumasi Batomate, but I go by an alias "Abuelo" or "AbueloSolos"
I'm a first year student studying computer science in the University of Port Harcourt.
I create digital art as a side hustle and also a skill im trying to get better at to develop my own game characters, I'm an aspiring game dev trying to raise enough money for my starter package (new PC)... and that's about it (-:
